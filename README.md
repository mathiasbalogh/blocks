**BOX BOX BOX**

*The Multiverse Simulator*

On load the page should have a randomly generated hex value.
	-The code for this was found in the comments at https://www.paulirish.com/2009/random-hex-color-code-snippets/
When the Big Bang button is pushed the page will create a new "universe" with another randomly selected hex value using the same code. Each universe comes complete with an "Annihilate" button marked with an "X".

Additionally, if you (the Creator) clicks on a given universe, she/he can remove light from said universe.

Stretch goal:To randomly assign some of the universes to have a variable life that is a boolean value. If this value were to be true, upon destroying a universe the creator would be alerted that they destroyed a universe with life in it.
